# Polygon Python Client - WebSocket & RESTful APIs

Python client for the [Polygon.io API](https://polygon.io).

## Install

`pip install polygon-api-client~=1.0.0b`

Requires Python >= 3.8.

## Getting started
See the [Getting Started](https://polygon-api-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Getting-Started.html)
section in our docs or view the [examples](./examples) directory.

## Contributing

For now, we're generally not accepting pull requests from outside contributors
but we're open to bug reports and feature requests. Or if you have more general
feedback, feel free to reach out on
our [Slack channel](https://polygon.io/contact).

## Release planning
This client will attempt to follow the release cadence of our API.
When endpoints are deprecated and newer versions are added, the client will
maintain two methods in a backwards compatible way
(e.g. `list_trades` and `list_trades_v4(...)`).
When deprecated endpoints are removed from the API, we'll rename the versioned
method (e.g. `list_trades_v4(...)` -> `list_trades(...)`), remove the old method,
and release a new major version of the client.

The goal is to give users ample time to upgrade to newer versions of our API
_before_ we bump the major version of the client, and in general, we'll try to
bundle breaking changes like this to avoid frequent major version bumps.

Exceptions to this are:

- Methods under `client.vx`. These are expiremental.
- Methods that start with `_*`. We use these internally.
- Type annotations. We may modify these based on our JSON responses.
- We may add model fields.
